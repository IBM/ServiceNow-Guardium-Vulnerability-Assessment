## Overview

This repository holds the **IBM Guardium Data Protection** ServiceNow module code for integration with ServiceNow Vulnerability Response module.  This code will synchronize CMDB and VA data between ServiceNow and IBM Guardium providing centralized management of vulnerability data in ServiceNow.

## Requirements

### IBM Guardium
- IBM Guardium 11.5 + Patch 525.  You can also use 11.4 + Patch 441 (available in August 2022), Patch 460 will add CVSS Attack Vector. Patch 525 contains several performance fixes.
- IBM Guardium user with Guardium `vulnerability-access` role (or Guardium `admin` role) 
- (Optional) Add `vulnerability-access` role to all existing Guardium data sources to permit the ServiceNow plug-in the ability to update and delete existing data sources which result from changes to ServiceNow CMDB

### ServiceNow
- Tested on ServiceNow releases: Rome, San Diego, Tokyo, Utah
- [ServiceNow Vulnerability Response](https://www.servicenow.com/products/vulnerability-response.html) module
- [ServiceNow Vulnerability Response Integration with NVD](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?version=latest&topicname=nvd-vuln-integration.html) module
- [ServiceNow Configuration Compliance](https://www.servicenow.com/content/dam/servicenow-assets/public/en-us/doc-type/resource-center/data-sheet/ds-security-operations.pdf) module (optional)

## Issues

- If you wish to do a full synchronization of data, you can delete all **Integrations Runs** then click **Execute Now** and the data for this integration will be fully synchronized.  Otherwise, the integration does a partial synchronization based on the date of the last successful Integration Run.
